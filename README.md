# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting time series data, specifically stock prices. The analysis includes data collection, preprocessing, decomposition, and forecasting using a simple moving average method. The results are visualized to provide insights into historical trends and future predictions.

## Features

- Data collection from historical stock price data.
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
- Time series decomposition into trend and noise components.
- Forecasting future stock prices using a simple moving average.
- Visualization of historical data, trend, and forecast results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for data visualization.

## Installation
